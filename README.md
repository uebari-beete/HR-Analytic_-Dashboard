# HR-Analytic_-Dashboard
This project provides practical experience in designing a professional Tableau dashboard using real-world HR data from Yellow. I explored the use of bar charts, line graphs, Lollipop charts, scorecards, and other visualization tools to build an interactive dashboard that  transforms raw data into meaningful insights for strategic decision making in HR and workforce management.

Yellow requires an in-depth analysis of employee income
trends and workforce demographics to enhance financial
planning and retention strategies. Major challenges
include identifying salary distribution patterns, predicting
income trends, and examining how factors such as age,
job role, and department influence earnings. Through
data visualization in Tableau, Yellow aims to uncover
actionable insights into salary dynamics and workforce
composition.
