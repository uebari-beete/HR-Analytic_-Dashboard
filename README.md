# HR-Analytic_-Dashboard
This project provides practical experience in designing a professional Tableau dashboard using real-world HR data from Yellow. I explored the use of bar charts, line graphs, Lollipop charts, scorecards, and other visualization tools to build an interactive dashboard that  transforms raw data into meaningful insights for strategic decision making.
